Feature: Sub Projects
    In order to manage sub-projects
    As a PL I need to be able to add/edit sub-projects for the projects that I lead

    Scenario: PL Adding a sub-project
        Given I am logged in as "PL.User1" using password "PL.Pass1"

        And I fill in "new_description" with "New Sub Project Description"
        And I press "Create Sub-Project"
        Then I should see "The Sub-Project was created successfully"
