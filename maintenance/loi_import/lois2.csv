"AVID","Aesthetics, Visualization, Interaction, and Design",,,"AVID; LPD; (COMMCAR)","In our data-driven society, decisions are increasingly informed by engagement with visualization. Moving beyond utilitarian concerns of efficiency and usability, this project will investigate the interplay between aesthetics and personalization, generating appealing new ways to visualize and interact with data. Drawing on a variety of aesthetic traditions and models of how people analyze data, we will re-imagine the visualization interface, enabling Canadians to be more imaginative, innovative, and connected.","Sheelagh Carpendale","Christopher Collins","Rock Leung, SAP","BIG DATA",,"AVID.pdf",
"BELIEVE","Believable Characters and Stories for Games and Simulations",,,"BELIEVE2","Our goal is to enable designers to create more believable scenarios and to create virtual characters that exhibit more believable behaviours in virtual worlds. Virtual worlds include video games, simulations, training and treatment environments. The quality of scenarios and virtual character behaviours has a huge impact on the quality of the user experience, when there is high reliance on avatar-virtual character interactions such as story-based games, or simulations / training / treatments that are based on relationships.","Duane Szafron","David Mould","Aaryn Flynn, BioWare","ENTERTAINMENT",,"BELIEVE.pdf",
"C-3PO","Customised Configuration and Context-dependent Performance Optimisation",,,"(CUSTOM); (MOBIS); (PROGRES)","Computation is the key to solving many of the grand challenges of our time, in areas such as healthcare decision support, planning and simulation. Much can be gained by customising hard- and software systems for optimised performance in specific situations by means of automated configuration. This project aims to develop core methods for such customization, and demonstrate their efficacy across a broad range of applications, including explicit memory management on highly parallel machines, treatment policies in healthcare, and large-scale parallel probabilistic and hierarchical planning for autonomous agents.","Martin Müller","Holger Hoos<br />Alexandra Fedorova","Mary Fenelon, IBM","OTHER",,"C-3PO.pdf",

Ministry of Health","HEALTH",,"CHRONIC.pdf",
"CONNECT","Connecting and Learning through Social Play",,,"COGS","People spend a significant amount of time playing social games. The challenge we address in this project is: How can we leverage the motivational pull of social play to connect people, empower individuals, crowdsource work, gamify learning, and generate revenue? We address this challenge through 6 subprojects (Foster, Scaffold, Gamify, Socialize, Match, and Evaluate), involving research by scientists, artists, and social scientists from 8 provinces, in collaboration with 20 industry partners, and many receptors.","Regan Mandryk","Carman Neustaedter","Danny Robinson, Perch Communications","LEARNING",,"CONNECT.pdf",
"DATUM","Data- and User-driven Modelling of Visual Content",,,"COLT; DATUM; MEASURE","Visual content creation is in high demand in many application domains including education, design, manufacturing, entertainment, and health informatics. While it is relatively easy to aquire image/video/low-level 3D measurement data, it is difficult to generate application-specific digital models that are realistic, diverse (even creative), functional, and adaptable. In this project, we address the modeling challenge by developing novel approaches to data capture and data- and user-driven modeling, leveraging recent advances in data acquisition technology, knowledge-driven analysis, simulation, as well as the accelerated accumulation of ""big data''.","Pierre Poulin","Richard Zhang","Jos Stam, Autodesk Research","ENTERTAINMENT",,"DATUM.pdf",

This project will contribute to knowledge about how and in what ways digital media can support the development of pedagogies and curriculum that are both ludic and educational. In addition we will study the processes by which marginalized and ‘on the edge’ groups are supported and encouraged in the move from consumers of digital media and technologies to creative producers in both formal classroom setting and informal learning environments.","Jennifer Jenson","Sean Gouglas","Brenda Gershkovitch, Silicon Sisters","LEARNING",,"ENGAGE.pdf",

KIDZ will develop and validate best practices for designing interactive systems that support children’s learning in high impact, traditionally underserved areas in child development, including games, collaboration tools, therapeutic interventions, and media production; as well as build Canada-wide educational networks.","Alissa Antle","Karon MacLean","Kori Inkpen Quinn, Microsoft Research - Redmond","LEARNING",,"KIDZ.pdf",
"KNOW","Knowledge Networking for Organizational Work",,,"CRI; (ENOW); (SNETS)","Knowledge-based work is often the activity of many experts, from different disciplines, using& a variety of tools for discipline-specific and collaborative tasks. Supporting this complex ecosystem requires new software tools to enable and coordinate the exchange of digital artifacts and information within a team in order to maintain awareness and cohesion and to effectively communicate and disseminate a team’s work to potential receptors in order to amplify its impact.

Almost every human endeavour can benefit from making sense of the information within such data. A range of disciplines each bring specific concepts, techniques and tool to the general task of interrogating, visualizing, analysing and understanding complex data. All contribute. None suffice. It is, however, widely understood that effective approaches and systems will combine human and machine capabilities. We need better and more comprehensive models for sensemaking. That is why this project is called Sense-I: ""I make sense of big data"".","Wolfgang Stuerzlinger","Charles Clarke<br />Melanie Tory","Alan Keahey, IBM Business Analytics - Office of the CTO","BIG DATA",,"SENSE-I.pdf",
