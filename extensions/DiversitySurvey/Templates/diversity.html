Instead, you may identify as Cree, Blackfoot, Mi'kmaq, Dene, or Nakota Sioux, etc. All of these identities are part of the umbrella term of Indigenous People.</p>

    <h3><span class="number">4.</span> Do you identify as a member of a visible minority/person of colour?</h3>
    <div class="answer">
        <p>The Canada Employment Equity Act uses the term “visible minority” and defines it as individuals who are non-Caucasian in race or non-white in colour. It does not typically include Indigenous Peoples unless they are of mixed origin, with one parent a member of a visible minority group. We recognize that there may be a preference to instead identify as a “person of colour” or by an individual’s race or ethnicity. The options below are based on Canada Census categories and the Employment Equity Act.</p>
