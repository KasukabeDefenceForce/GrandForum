<h3>Why is GlycoNet conducting a census survey?</h3>
<p>The GlycoNet Board of Directors, Management, and the EDI Committee is committed to advancing EDI principles and practice within our network to realize the benefits of a diverse and inclusive research, learning, and working environment. We believe that fostering respect, belonging, and fair opportunities for career progression advances research excellence. GlycoNet must also be able to provide EDI-related information required by grant funding agencies documenting our collection of data, analysis of results, and informing strategic planning.</p>
<p>The first census was conducted in 2018 and provided benchmark demographic data. To continue to understand the workforce and student composition, we need to conduct a census at regular intervals (every three to five years).</p>

<h3>What is different about the 2022 survey?</h3>
<p>Questions asking GlycoNet members to share experiences of inclusion as well as feedback on EDI training have been added to collect data on the current working and learning environment and to identify strategies to continue to enhance respect and inclusion for everyone in GlycoNet. The 2022 demographic questions are similar to those in the 2018 questionnaire but have been revised to align with advancements in, and continued alignment with, terminology used by the Canada Employment Equity Act and Statistics Canada. The self-identification demographic questions include gender identity, sexual orientation, Indigenous/Aboriginal Peoples, Visible/Racial Minorities, and Persons with Disabilities.</p>

<h3>Who is conducting the 2022 survey?</h3>
<p>GlycoNet Board of Directors, the EDI Committee, and Management has partnered with an external consultant to update the 2018 survey and to conduct the 2022 census survey. The EDI Committee is providing oversight and input into the design to ensure it captures relevant data to advance EDI in STEM.</p>

<h3>How can GlycoNet members participate?</h3>
<p>The survey will be distributed via the GlycoNet Forum. It is the same method used for the 2018 survey and it remains a secure method of data collection.</p>

<h3>Who should participate and is it mandatory?</h3>
<p>All members of the GlycoNet community are encouraged to participate in the census survey. A good response rate provides a more accurate picture of our research environment to identify where we are at in terms of representation, inclusion, and to inform next steps.</p>
<p>You may choose to skip questions and answer only those you would like to respond to. If for any reason(s) you do not wish to complete the entire census survey, please check the corresponding box at the beginning of the questionnaire to bring you to the end of the form. In addition, please consider sharing why you have decided against completing the survey and under what circumstances you might consider participating.</p>
<p>If you completed the 2018 GlycoNet EDI Survey, thank you! It is important that you complete the 2022 survey as well. Given that a number of the demographic questions have been modified and how you identify may have changed, it is important to complete the 2022 survey to ensure accuracy of census data.</p>
<p>If you have completed an EDI census survey with your primary institution, we ask that you still complete the GlycoNet questionnaire as your survey responses are strictly confidential and are not shared with other institutions. Also, it is critical for GlycoNet to have an accurate picture and understanding of its own community so that programs and initiatives are relevant and timely. The concrete steps to identify and remove barriers to full participation must be understood at the local level.</p>

<h3>How can the 2022 EDI census survey be accessed and how long will it take?</h3>
<p>The survey will be open on the GlycoNet forum for a three-week period (January 31 to February 18, 2022) and should take 5 to 10 minutes to complete. Survey reminders will be sent at the mid-point and then a couple of days before the survey closes. While the survey is open, you will be able to change your responses. Once the survey closes, you will not have access to your responses to change them. If you wish to change any of your responses following the survey close, you will need to contact our external consultant for assistance.</p>
<p>The survey is available in both English and French.</p>

<h3>How will personal information be protected and will it be shared with others?</h3>
<p>Some members of the GlycoNet community may be hesitant about sharing information about their identity and about their experiences of inclusion. All data is collected with stringent controls in place, will be analyzed anonymously by Catherine Anley Consulting and results will be presented on an aggregate level – no one will be identified by name. All data is stored on the secure GlycoNet systems, is strictly confidential, and individual responses will never be shared.</p>
