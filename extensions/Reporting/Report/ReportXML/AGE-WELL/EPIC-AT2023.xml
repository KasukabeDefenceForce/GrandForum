                <h3>Background Information</h3>
                <p><b>About EPIC-AT HRTP</b></p>

                <p>The Early Professionals, Inspired Careers in AgeTech Health Research Training Platform (EPIC-AT HRTP) is a national training platform that will prepare graduate students, postdoctoral fellows and early career researchers to be future leaders in digital health solutions for older adults with complex health needs.</p>

                <p>Powered by AGE-WELL, EPIC-AT is led by researchers from 11 universities and research hospitals across 6 Canadian provinces. It is hosted at the University of Toronto. This unique platform is funded by the Canadian Institutes of Health Research (CIHR) with additional support provided by 41 collaborating organizations from across Canada.</p>

                <p>The competency-based, experiential learning platform is an extension of AGE-WELL’s globally-leading EPIC training program.</p>
            
                <p><b>EPIC-AT Early Career Researcher Awards in Patient-Oriented Research</b></p>
            
                <p>EPIC-AT is pleased offer Black, Indigenous, and racialized early career researchers funding to support patient-oriented research and patient engagement. Funding for these awards was made available through the Strategy for Patient-Oriented Research (SPOR) Supplement to CIHR Health Research Training Platforms.</p>

                <p>EPIC-AT is built on a foundation of equity, diversity, inclusion, and accessibility. Racialized people comprise over one-fifth of the Canadian population, yet are significantly under-represented as both faculty members and senior university leaders (Cukier, 2021). Moreover, as found by an Innovation, Science, and Economic Development Canada sponsored survey, tenured faculty tend to be less racially diverse and more likely to be male.</p>

                <p>These awards are meant to increase financial support for Black, Indigenous, and other racialized early career researchers to pursue patient-oriented research and patient engagement activities and help build their independent research programs as they pertain to digital health solutions for older adults with complex health needs.</p>

                <p>Applicants are encouraged to review the Use of Grant Funds section of the <a href='http://www.nserc-crsng.gc.ca/Professors-Professeurs/FinancialAdminGuide-GuideAdminFinancier/index_eng.asp'>Tri-Agency (CIHR, NSERC and SSHRC) Financial Administration Guide</a> for a complete listing and description of allowable costs and activities.</p>
            
                <p><i>Priority Research Areas</i></p>
                
                <p>Visible minority and immigrant older adults are particularly susceptible to the digital divide due to the intersecting identity markers of race, class, age, and gender.</p>

                <p>Moreover, Indigenous older adults are one of the most rapidly growing group of seniors in Canada. Due to the continued effects of colonization and systemic biases, Indigenous older adults face a higher and rising prevalence of complex health needs including multimorbidity. It is imperative to swiftly develop and implement culturally safe and appropriate solutions.</p>

                <p>As such, EPIC-AT welcomes especially applications from those who will explicitly serve equity-deserving groups.</p>

                <i>We expect to offer the following 1 year awards in this call:</i>
                <ul><li>2 EPIC-AT Early Career Researcher Awards in Patient-Oriented Research at $20,000</li></ul>

                        <b>Impact Plan</b><br />
                        <p>EPIC-AT seeks to equip trainees and ECRs with the skills to translate their work into real-world impact.</p>

                        <p>While the success ultimately depends on the rate of uptake and meaningful application of knowledge or products by end users, non-traditional academic knowledge mobilization, commercialization and effective implementation of solutions are a platform goal.</p>

                        <p>Not every Fellowship or grant recipient is expected to be directly responsible for a commercial outcome or uptake of knowledge, but all projects should be actively contributing to these overall goals.</p>

                        <p>Please address your plan to ensure your work achieves the impact described in the previous section.</p>
