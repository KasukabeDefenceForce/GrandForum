                <p>The NCE Program has the responsibility of delivering on short, medium and long-term commitments. These are categorized as immediate, intermediate and long-term outcomes of the NCE Program. These outcomes are achieved through the selection and funding of NCE networks who collectively, and through collaboration with the NCE Secretariat, deliver on these outcomes. The program outcomes include:</p>
                <p>Immediate outcomes:
                <ul>
                    <li>increase networking and collaboration among researchers from Canada and abroad;</li>
                    <li>develop leading-edge research findings that are relevant to the needs of the user sector (e.g. private and public sectors, non-governmental organizations, and others) and Canada’s socio-economic development;</li>
                    <li>create nation-wide, multidisciplinary and multisectoral research partnerships between universities and the user sector (e.g. private and public sectors, non-governmental organizations, and others); and</li>
                    <li>establish training that promotes multidisciplinary and multisectoral research approaches and encourages trainees to consider the economic, social, environmental, and ethical implications of their work.</li>
                </ul></p>
                <p>Intermediate/long-term outcomes:

                    <li>accelerate the exchange of research results within the Network and the use of this knowledge within Canada by organizations that can harness it for Canadian economic and social development;</li>
                    <li>attract and retain world-class researchers and highly qualified personnel (HQP) in areas essential to Canadian economic and social development;</li>
                    <li>create functional, multi-regional, and interdisciplinary research teams;</li>
                    <li>develop a pool of HQP in areas essential to Canadian economic and social development; and</li>
                    <li>increase Canada’s international visibility and reputation.</li>
                </ul></p>
                <h3>Development of Highly Qualified Personnel (HQP)</h3>
                <p>The training and retention of HQP is imperative to maximize the effectiveness of the Networks’ contribution to the wealth, wellness and well-being of Canadians.  The Training Program proposed by the Network is expected to add value to the formal training initiatives already available through the academic community and should aim at helping HQP find employment in the Canadian economy (i.e., private sector partners, government, etc.). The multidisciplinary and multisectoral nature of a network should be utilized to provide unique mentorship and training opportunities to maximize HQP retention and integration in all facets of the workforce.<br />
                Elements being considered are:
                    <ul>
                        <li>the ability to attract, develop and retain outstanding researchers in research areas and technologies critical to Canadian productivity, economic growth, public policy and quality of life; and</li>
                        <li>training strategies that expose HQP to the full range of economic, social, and ethical implications of the Network’s research by involving them in activities from the initial research discovery to its application through to practical social and economic benefits.</li>
                    </ul>
