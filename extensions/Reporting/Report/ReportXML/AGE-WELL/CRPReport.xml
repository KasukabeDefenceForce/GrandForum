                <p>Please provide a short case study of outstanding work or achievement in any of the evaluation impact areas (Scientific Excellence, Networking and Partnerships, Knowledge Mobilization, Commercialization, and HQP Training). Case studies provide a concrete example of how a research project and its findings have contributed to real-world impact. These stories are a great opportunity to promote the amazing work accomplished within AGE-WELL. We will draw on these case studies as we promote the work accomplished over the past five years. We encourage teams to insert, attach or provide links to any relevant images connected to this work.</p>
                <u>Language</u>
                <p>The case study is aimed at a very wide audience:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>avoid jargon and overly “academic” style of writing</li>
                    <li>assume the reader is not familiar with your disciplinary concepts and language</li>
                    <li>assume the reader is educated to a reasonable level</li>
                    <li>the tone should be less formal than usual academic writing, and be engaging and easy-to-read but still “serious”.</li>
                </ul>
                <b>i. Summary of the impact (indicative maximum 250 words/half page)</b>
                <p>This section should briefly summarise the specific impact or novel contribution that is being described in the case study.  This should be written in engaging way that will communicate clearly to a lay audience- it may be useful to contact someone in your Institutions Communications department to craft this section.</p>

                    <li>Brief description of outputs, products, etc. that contributed to impact</li>
                    <li>How did this contribute to successful outcomes and impact?</li>

                <p>This section should provide a narrative to explain how this case study has made an impact and the nature and extent of the impact. The following should be provided:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>A clear explanation of the process or means through which the research led to, underpinned or made a contribution to the impact (for example, how it was disseminated, how it came to influence users or beneficiaries, or how it came to be exploited, taken up or applied).</li> 
                    <li>Where the case study was part of a wider body of research that contributed to the impact (for example, where there has been research collaboration with other institutions or grants), the case study should specify the particular contribution of the case study and acknowledge other key research contributions.</li>
                    <li>Beneficiaries – who or what community, constituency or organisation has benefitted, been affected or impacted on.</li>
                    <li>Nature of the impact – how they have benefitted, been affected or impacted on.</li>
                    <li>Evidence or indicators of the extent of the impact described, as appropriate to the case being made.</li>

                <p>An important part of AGE-WELL’s mandate is to promote and put into action key outputs from our first five years. To achieve this, we are developing a knowledge repository of ‘shareable’ outputs to support and educate other project teams or trainees within the network, or make available outside the network, if appropriate and with permission. Note that we are not looking for academic journal publications, but rather guidelines, manuals, scoping reviews, white papers, policy briefs, educational materials, data sets, frameworks, toolkits, video/films and/or websites etc.</p>
                
                <p>Since your team has been reporting outputs on Forum for five years now, we expect that these key outputs have already been reported—we are looking for you to help us understand which ones you consider appropriate and relevant to share in order to support continued growth of AGE-WELL and development of the sector as a whole.</p>
                
                <p>Please list what you consider the top 5 ‘shareable’ outputs of this project. Please indicate whether each output should remain internal to AGE-WELL or whether you think it is ripe for broader dissemination (external). Please provide links and/or attachments of materials below.</p>
