                <p>Prior to undertaking the reviews, please familiarize yourself with the <a href='http://agewell-nce.ca/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/AGE-WELL-Graduate-Student-and-Postdoctoral-Awards-Package-3.pdf'>AGE-WELL Graduate Student and Postdoctoral Awards in Technology and Aging
Information Package</a> and the <a href='http://www.agewell-nce.ca/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/AGE-WELL-Network-Goals.pdf'>AGE-WELL Network Goals</a> document that were provided to applicants.</p>

<p>To make the review process as simple as possible, provide a single overall score for each criterion using the following scale:</p>

<p>Please use the following scale to provide an overall assessment on each of the three criteria</p>

<table frame='box' rules='all'>
    <tr>
        <th>Potential Impact</th><th>Impact Score</th><th>Descriptor</th><th>Additional Guidance on Strengths/Weaknesses</th>
    </tr>
    <tr><td rowspan='3'>High</td><td>9</td><td>Exceptional</td><td>Exceptionally strong with essentially no weaknesses</td></tr>
    <tr><td>8</td><td>Outstanding</td><td>Extremely strong with negligible weaknesses</td></tr>
    <tr><td>7</td><td>Excellent</td><td>Very strong with only some minor weaknesses</td></tr>
    <tr><td rowspan='3'>Moderate</td><td>6</td><td>Very Good</td><td>Strong but with numerous minor weaknesses</td></tr>
    <tr><td>5</td><td>Good</td><td>Strong but with at least one moderate weakness</td></tr>
    <tr><td>4</td><td>Satisfactory</td><td>Some strengths but also some moderate weaknesses</td></tr>
    <tr><td rowspan='3'>Low</td><td>3</td><td>Fair</td><td>Some strengths but with at least one major weakness</td></tr>
    <tr><td>2</td><td>Marginal</td><td>A few strengths and a few major weaknesses</td></tr>
    <tr><td>1</td><td>Poor</td><td>Very few strengths and numerous major weaknesses</td></tr>
    <tr><td colspan='4'><b>Definitions</b></td></tr>
    <tr><td colspan='4'>Minor: weakness that does not substantially lessen the quality of the proposal or potential of the candidate.<br />
Moderate: weakness that lessens the quality of the proposal or potential of the candidate<br />
Major: weakness that severely limits the quality of the proposal or potential of the candidate</td></tr>
</table>
<p>Please use the comment boxes to justify your score. We have provided some questions to guide scoring on each criterion. Please bear these in mind, but use your own judgment if you think other factors are relevant.</p>

<p>There is also an overall comments box where you can highlight the key attributes of the applicant. Please note that in these HQP awards we are particularly trying to identify candidates with strong potential to go on to be <b>part of AGE-WELL’s “New Generation”</b> of researchers, e.g.</p>
<ul>
    <li>Vision for their research that goes beyond traditional disciplines and silos</li>
    <li>New ideas and approaches to old problems</li>
    <li>Willingness to learn new skills</li>
    <li>Awareness of the importance of commercial and social impact</li>
    <li>Strong identification with AGE-WELL vision</li>
    <li>Potential contribution to HQP community</li>
</ul>
<p>Emphasis here should be on potential rather than the technicalities of the research proposal itself. For example, the candidate may not have well worked out plans for knowledge mobilization or commercialization, but demonstrates a keen willingness to learn and adapt. We should also be thinking about the value that this student will gain from being part of AGE-WELL training environment, rather than a traditional one and where a more traditional scholarship is appropriate.</p>

<p>A key aspect of AGE-WELL’s training philosophy is that we have the ability to fund HQP who may not be funded through traditional funding sources (e.g. CIHR, NSERC, SSHRC). We are looking to fund individuals who are thinking “outside of the box”, and who are interested in pursuing non-traditional roles within their training program. For example we will strongly consider and encourage applicants focusing on developing new products and start-up companies, or someone who is not interested in pursuing a traditional academic position but would rather work in industry, governmental, or other community-based positions.</p>
