                <h3>About AGE-WELL</h3>
                <p>AGE-WELL NCE is Canada’s Technology and Aging Network. The pan-Canadian network brings together researchers, older adults, caregivers, partner organizations and future leaders to accelerate the delivery of technology-based solutions that make a meaningful difference in the lives of Canadians. AGE-WELL researchers are producing technologies, services, policies and practices that improve quality of life for older adults and caregivers, and generate social and economic benefits for Canada.</p>
                
                <h3>Description</h3>
                <p>The 2020 Emerging Entrepreneur Award is part of AGE-WELL’s effort to address the public health challenges associated with the novel coronavirus pandemic. The rapid spread of COVID-19 has highlighted especially the vulnerability of Canada’s older adults and the potential impact of technological innovations to mitigate the spread of disease and minimize its disruptive impact on health and fulfillment of psychosocial needs.</p>

                <p>This $25,000 award is designed to give a new entrepreneur the financial resources to focus on making their ideas viable and rapidly deployable in service to our stakeholders.</p>

                <p>Applicants to this call of the AGE-WELL Emerging Entrepreneur Award must clearly communicate their innovation’s relevance as a COVID-19 countermeasure. For example, but not limited to:</p>

All AGE-WELL researchers and trainees have access to the AGE-WELL partner network. We expect that the majority of AGE-WELL funded projects will be carried out in conjunction with a community or industrial partner, for example: a technology company, a service provider, or a government department or agency.</p>

Where possible, AGE-WELL will attempt to link projects with appropriate AGE-WELL partners.</li>
