All AGE-WELL researchers and trainees have access to the AGE-WELL partner network. We expect that the majority of AGE-WELL funded projects will be carried out in conjunction with a community or industrial partner, for example: a technology company, a service provider, or a government department or agency.</p>

                            <li>If your research does not currently involve working with a partner organization, identify the type of partner that would be appropriate for your project and how your project might benefit from partner engagement (e.g. Co-development of technology, knowledge mobilization, experiential learning). Where possible, AGE-WELL will attempt to link projects with appropriate AGE-WELL partners.</li>
