                <h2>Section 5: Networking and Partnerships (approx. 1 page)</h2>
                <small>
                    <p>All AGE-WELL projects are expected to be joint actions by researchers and partner organizations. Partners should have a significant and active role in all aspects of the project. For example, partners may take the lead on addressing questions related to practice, policy, and/or service delivery. Partners may also take the lead on technology development, where appropriate. Partners may be drawn from various stakeholder groups (e.g. industry, government, service providers, seniors group, NGOs, etc.). Similarly, project teams will be expected to collaborate with other teams within their identified Challenge Areas and network across AGE-WELL.</p>

                    <p>Research projects conducted by Quebec-based teams or having a collaboration with Quebec-based teams may receive additional funding from MEDTEQ in this application. One important criterion is the involvement of an industrial partner having operations in Quebec. Note that MEDTEQ can provide support to teams to help identify Quebec-based industrial partners during either the RFP or Catalyst phase. You will be asked to check a box to be considered for additional MEDTEQ funding.</p>

                    <p>Projects are expected to generate social and economic benefits by ensuring the rapid flow of ideas and innovations from researchers to receptors. It should be noted that KTEE includes both knowledge mobilization and commercialization. Your plans should consider:</p>

                    <p>Describe how the project will develop highly qualified personnel (HQP) beyond their typical disciplinary training (see <a href='http://agewell-nce.ca/epic-program' target='_blank'>AGE-WELL’s EPIC Program</a>). HQP development is expected to:</p>

                        <li>Expose HQP to the full range of economic, social, and ethical implications of the Network’s research by involving them in activities from the initial research discovery to its practical application.</li>
                        <li>Add value to training beyond their normal disciplinary training opportunities through innovative mentorship programs.</li>
                        <li>Enhance capacity in relation to the needs of the receptors.</li>

                    <p>Additional funding is available through Mitacs to fund internships for graduate students and post-doctoral fellows in AGE-WELL’s Core Research Program. Relevant core research projects will have expedited access to Mitacs funding for training of graduate students and post-doctoral fellows. Under Accelerate, each internship is valued at $15,000, which is cost-shared by Mitacs and the partner (for-profit and not-for-profit organizations within Canada), with larger-scale and longer-term projects possible. Under Elevate, each 2-year fellowship is valued at $120,000, which is cost-shared by Mitacs and the partner. Mitacs also dispenses the training component, valued at $15,000. Applicants are encouraged to contact their local <a href='https://www.mitacs.ca/en/contact-us/business-development' target='_blank'>Mitacs Business Development Representative</a> to evaluate the eligibility of the proposed partner organization, project, and obtain the application form for the correct program (Mitacs Accelerate or Elevate) before applying.</p>

                    <p>You will be asked to check a box to be considered for Mitacs funding for graduate students and post-doctoral fellows.
