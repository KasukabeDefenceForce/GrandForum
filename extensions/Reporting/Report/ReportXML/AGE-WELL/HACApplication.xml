            <![CDATA[
                <p>The 2023 Catalyst Funding Program in Healthy Aging aims to identify and support emerging research in technology-enabled healthy aging, foster networking and collaboration, and build capacity in aging innovation research in Canada.</p>
                
                It is expected that small-scale projects or pilot studies funded through this call will provide a foundation for future larger research projects or funding applications. Examples of supported activities for this call include:
                <ul>
                    <li>Feasibility studies aiming to generate preliminary data, observations, or knowledge;</li>
                    <li>Advancement of novel products, including technologies, with the potential for significant impact, but that may be currently unsupported by proof of concept or preliminary data;</li>
                    <li>Development of new tools, methodologies, protocols, theoretical models or frameworks;</li>
                    <li>Planning and/or development activities of expert teams (e.g., multi-disciplinary, trans-disciplinary, etc.) coming together to address healthy aging research priorities; and</li>
                    <li>Secondary analyses of existing data sets to improve the evidence for decision-making and create new knowledge.</li>
                </ul>
                
                <h3>PRIORITY AREAS</h3>

                    <li>Solutions that include and meet the needs of vulnerable and equity-deserving groups of people.</li>
                    <li>Quality improvement studies that investigate novel and innovative ways to improve the lives of older Canadians.</li>
                </ul>
                
                <h3>APPLICATION REQUIREMENTS</h3>
