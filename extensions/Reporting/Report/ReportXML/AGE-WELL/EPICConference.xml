                <p>AGE-WELL, Canada’s AgeTech network, is dedicated to the creation of technologies and services that benefit older adults and caregivers. Our aim is to help older Canadians maintain their independence, health and quality of life through technologies, programs and services that increase their safety, support their independent living, and enhance their social participation.</p>
                
                <p>AGE-WELL has identified <a href="https://agewell-nce.ca/challenge-areas" target="_blank">8 Challenge Areas</a> – difficult and complex problem areas found through extensive public consultation – that demand innovation and deployment of real-world solutions. The EPIC Conference (2022) is an opportunity for AGE-WELL students, postdoctoral fellows, research staff and ECRs to share their research, highlight their potential impact and stakeholder partnerships and connect with colleagues. This year, we are pleased to feature invited panels from select AGE-WELL partners. We are also excited to bring together attendees who are older adults, caregivers, and government and industry partners from around the world.</p>

                <p>The 10-day virtual conference will comprise of virtual sessions dedicated to one of the identified challenge areas, professional development and expert-based panels, and trainee-hosted social events. French-language sessions will also be hosted by AGE-WELL partners.</p>
                
                <p><b>Oral Presentation Stream</b><br />
                These sessions will be hosted on Crowdcast and comprise of an introduction to the Challenge Area presented by the session chair, and live presentations from researchers and their stakeholder partners.</p>
                
                <p>Please note that presenters are required to accompany their 10-minute talks with a PowerPoint presentation of no more than 10 slides (inclusive of title slide and bibliography).</p>
                
                <p>Priority will be given to presenters who are co-presenting with stakeholders. There will be an additional 5 minutes allocated for Q&A after presentations.</p>
