                <p>AGE-WELL, Canada’s AgeTech network, is dedicated to the creation of technologies and services that benefit older adults and caregivers. Our aim is to help older Canadians maintain their independence, health and quality of life through technologies and services that increase their safety and security, support their independent living, and enhance their social participation.</p>

                <p>Through extensive public consultation, AGE-WELL has identified 8 Challenge Areas – difficult and complex problem areas – that demand innovation and deployment of real-world solutions.</p>

                <p>The EPIC Conference (2020) is an opportunity for AGE-WELL HQP to share their research, highlight their potential impact, and connect with colleagues.</p>
                
                <p>It will comprise of 8 virtual sessions, each dedicated to one of the identified challenge areas. Each session will involve 2 streams of presentations – a traditional oral presentation and a Twitter conference presentation. Additional sessions will include interactive design workshops, a roundtable on pivoting your research during COVID, and a hybrid career presentation and workshop.</p>

                <p><i>Oral Presentation Stream</i></p>
                <p>These sessions will be hosted on Crowdcast and comprise of an introduction to the challenge area presented by the session chair, 3 oral presentations, and a follow up comment by a stakeholder that places these presentations into the larger discourse and addresses potential research impact.</p>
                
                <p>Please note that presenters are required to accompany their 10 minute talks with a PowerPoint presentation of no more than 10 slides (inclusive of title slide and bibliography). Each presenter will be allocated an additional 5 minutes for Q&A after their presentation.</p>
                
                <p><i>Twitter Presentation Stream</i></p>
                <p>In this conference stream, HQP will be challenged to encapsulate their presentations into 5 pre-scheduled tweets using their personal Twitter accounts. Presenters will be given a timeslot in which to release their tweets and be expected to be present for an interactive Q&A Twitter session and at least 1 other session scheduled in their stream.</p>
                
                <p><b>Call for Abstracts</b></p>
                <p>Presentation proposals for both streams are invited from <b>all AGE-WELL HQP including alumni</b>. Applicants are encouraged to review the full challenge area booklet here and ensure they are available for their sessions on the dates below.</p>

                <p>Applications will be open in Forum from May 1 – May 18, 2020.</p>
