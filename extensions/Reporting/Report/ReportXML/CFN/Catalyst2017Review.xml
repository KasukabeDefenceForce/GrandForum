                        <p>Is the end of grant knowledge translation plan well described and appropriate?  The applicant was asked to a) Describe the opportunities for knowledge translation and exchange and/or technology transfer or commercialization of the research proposed along a continuum leading to social or economic impacts or policy and practice change and b) Identify the KT framework that will be used and how it will be implemented.  Note: The framework should be one from the April 2012 Knowledge Translation Framework for Ageing and Health from the World Health Organization (http://www.who.int/ageing/publications/knowledge_translation.pdf).</p>

The applicant was asked to: a. describe the approaches and methods used in the study and why they are appropriate to meet the goals and objectives and deliver upon the proposed output(s) and provide any additional budget justification (in addition to what is in budget document) as it relates to the approaches and methods. (The proposal should be developed using an appropriate CAT strategy based on a CAT framework identified in the April 2012 Knowledge Translation Framework for Ageing and Health from the World Health Organization (http://www.who.int/ageing/publications/knowledge_translation.pdf)),  b. provide timelines showing when goals, objectives and outputs will be reached and provide any additional budget justification (in addition to what is in budget document) as it relates to the goals, objectives and outputs, and c. describe the potential barriers and challenges related to achieving the proposed goals and objectives and how applicant intends on overcoming these barriers and challenges.  Applicants were also asked to describe their mitigation strategy?</p>

Please review the Budget document (Excel document) and if necessary refer to Section 3.2.1 (Approach) for additional budget justification.  Note applicants were advised that, because of the limited overall budget amount (for this CAT competition) and the expected high interest in this competition, the budget justification within submitted proposals will be a major evaluation criterion.</p>
