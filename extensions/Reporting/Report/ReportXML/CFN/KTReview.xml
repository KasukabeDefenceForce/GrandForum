                    <li>Competition Goal: To advance previously funded CFN research evidence into practice thereby, ultimately strengthening Canada's healthcare system and improving care of Canadians living with frailty.</li>
                    <li>Because of the limited overall budget and expected high interest for this competition, the budget/budget justification will be a major evaluation criterion.  Note: Increasing budgetary requests will be expected to produce a proportionately greater impact and will undergo commensurate scrutiny as to their ability to achieve these impacts.</li>
                    <li>Proposals that secure cash and/or in kind matching contributions beyond the minimum 1:1 match will be at an advantage.</li>
