Does the project represent an opportunity for the ECR to enhance future partnerships? Does the ECR present a feasible plan to attract new partners? The applicant was asked to describe how completion of the proposed study will enhance their ability to develop future partnerships and collaborations with external organizations and stakeholders (e.g., health care practices, service providers, care facilities)</p>
