                <p><b>More information on the KFLA Centre for Healthy Aging:</b> This competition is designed to support ancillary studies on older adults aged 65y+ residing in the KFLA region who are participants in CFN’s AVOID Frailty Program via the KFLA Centre for Healthy Aging (healthyagingcentres.ca). AVOID Frailty is a community-driven primary prevention intervention that aims to enable uptake and maintenance of healthy behaviours for older adults.  These healthy behaviours are; <b>A</b>ctivity & exercise, older adult <b>V</b>accinations, <b>O</b>ptimization of medications, <b>I</b>nteract socially and <b>D</b>iet & nutrition. The central activity of the KFLA Centre for Healthy Aging is implementation of the AVOID Frailty Program, which operationalizes each of the five AVOID Frailty (www.AVOIDfrailty.ca) components together as a public health primary prevention intervention. The KFLA Centre for Healthy Aging is creating an enabling environment for behaviour change that includes co-ordinated assistance for older adults to identify, navigate, and access local community and social services</p>
