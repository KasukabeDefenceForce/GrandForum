                            <p>Is the end of grant knowledge translation plan well described and appropriate?  The applicant was asked to a) Describe the opportunities for knowledge translation and exchange and/or technology transfer or commercialization of the research proposed along a continuum leading to social or economic impacts or policy and practice change. Because of the relatively short-length of the CAT funding term, proposals must describe future implementation plans to demonstrate future scalability and spread.  b) Identify the KT framework that will be used and how it will be implemented.  Note: The framework should be one from the April 2012 Knowledge Translation Framework for Ageing and Health from the World Health Organization (<a href='http://www.who.int/ageing/publications/knowledge_translation.pdf' target='_blank'>http://www.who.int/ageing/publications/knowledge_translation.pdf</a>).</p>
