                <b>Definition of a Regional Centre for Healthy Aging (RCHA):</b>
                <p>A RCHA is comprised of like-minded team of individuals, residing within a defined geographic area, who are dedicated to implementing and promoting a community-based program to encourage older adults to engage in behaviour changes that prevent frailty and promote healthy aging. A RCHA demonstrates evidence of interdisciplinary collaborations and commitment to advancing knowledge dissemination, research, and community engagement to promote a holistic approach to healthy aging. As a leadership node for multisectoral initiatives, a RCHA is responsible for coordinating the implementation and management of the AVOID Frailty Program in a culturally, environmentally, and economically appropriate way that acknowledges and honours the characteristics of community members.</p>

                            <p>The applicant was asked to: 1) describe alignment and preparedness of the community to ensure the implementation of the AVOID Frailty Program can be completed in a timely manner, 2) Identify all feasibility issues, barriers, challenges, and limitation to the successful implementation and management of the RCHA, 3) Address issues related to budget constraints, time constraints, structural issues, and organizational and personnel challenges that may delay RCHA implementation, and 4) Discuss strategies for mitigating potential barriers to RCHA implementation, management, community outreach, and digital platform integration.  Have the applicants consulted with community members in the design of this proposal?</p></p>

                            <p>Considering the entire application, does the project describe a Regional Centre for Healthy Aging? Does the proposed RCHA have the necessary community members and partners to foster an enabling environment for behaviour change? Are knowledge users meaningfully involved? Have the applicants appropriately integrated their project with the AVOID (Activity, Vaccinate, Optimize Medication, Interact, and Diet) behaviours?</p>
                            <p><b>NOTE:</b> A Regional Centre for Healthy Aging  is comprised of like-minded team of individuals, residing within a defined geographic area, who are dedicated to implementing and promoting a community-based program to encourage older adults to engage in behaviour changes that prevent frailty and promote healthy aging. A RCHA demonstrates evidence of interdisciplinary collaborations and commitment to advancing knowledge dissemination, research, and community engagement to promote a holistic approach to healthy aging. As a leadership node for multisectoral initiatives, a RCHA is responsible for coordinating the implementation and management of the AVOID Frailty Program in a culturally, environmentally, and economically appropriate way that acknowledges and honours the characteristics of community members.</p>
                            <p><b>NOTE:</b>Meaningfully involved participation of knowledge users includes assisting in the planning and execution of the project and/or in assisting in the interpretation and translation/mobilization of findings.</p>
