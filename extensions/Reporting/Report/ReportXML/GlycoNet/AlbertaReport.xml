                <h3>RFP Description</h3>
                <p>The funding for this request for proposals (RFP) is being provided by Alberta Innovates (AI) and seeks to support Alberta-based projects that will lead to tangible benefits to the Province. This includes intellectual property, start-up companies, processes, products, services, policies and/or clinical practice guidelines that can be developed with Partners and/or Stakeholders. Given the source of funding, only investigators located in the Province of Alberta are eligible to apply for funding through this RFP. Investigators from outside of Alberta can be involved in projects, but must support their own activities through other sources of funding.</p>

                <p>A key goal of GlycoNet is to support research projects that are multi-disciplinary and preferably translational. Accordingly, this RFP seeks to fund projects that involve two or more research groups in different disciplines. Proposals that involve an investigator who is primarily funded by one of the Tri-Council agencies (e.g., CIHR) working with others primarily funded by one or both of the other Tri-Council agencies (e.g., NSERC and/or SSHRC) will be viewed most favorably.</p>

                <p>The front page of the Excel file is the total project budget. The other pages (labeled NPI-1, NPI-2 etc; NPI = Network Principal Investigator) are for each involved NI. The budget requested by each NI should be filled in on their respective pages, including the partner contributions that are to be directed to their laboratories. The totals will populate automatically on the first page. <b><i>The project leader is responsible for combining all of the NI budgets into a single Excel file</i></b>. The first page also contains the budget for the use of the core services in the project. <b><i>The project leader should coordinate the core services budget for the project</i></b>. If you are asked for a password when entering a number, you are attempting to enter a number in a field that will automatically populate.</p>

                Budget Guidelines:
                <ul>
                    <li>Projects can request up to $100,000/year for <b><i>one year</i></b> from GlycoNet.</li>
                    <li>Projects require a 1:2 match with partner funding (for every two dollars requested in the proposal from GlycoNet, at least one dollar in matching must be provided); at least 50% of the matching funds must be cash.</li>
                    <li>Funding from provincial funding sources (excluding Alberta Innovates), industry, foundations and federal funding, including from the Tri-Council (e.g., CIHR, NSERC, SSHRC) and CFI, is eligible for matching. However, NSERC Discovery Grant and CIHR Project Grant and SSHRC Insight Grant are not eligible.</li>
                    <li>The project budget should clearly show the co-contribution of partner funds in alignment with NCE and eligible project expenses.
                        <ul>
                            <li>Projects that involve an industrial partner will be viewed most favorably.</li>
                            <li>Projects with a higher level of matching funds (e.g. 1:1, Partners:GlycoNet) will be viewed more favorably.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li>The maximum salary for Graduate Students is $25,000/year and for Postdoctoral Fellows is $45,000/year.</li>
                    <li>Undergraduate student support should be limited to co-op students and should be listed in the technician line item.</li>
                    <li>Equipment is capped at $2,000/year/project.</li>
                    <li>Travel
                        <ul>
                            <li>Conference travel is capped at $1,500/year/NI/project.</li>

                        <ul>
                            <li>You should work with one of the Network screening partners (CDRD, McMaster HTS Lab, SPARC) to develop a budget and a plan of action (i.e. milestones). These costs should be incorporated into the project budget.</li>
                            <li>Funding for the screen itself will go to the screening partner. The development of the assay can be done either at the screening partner, or in the lab of a NI (to be determined in your discussions with the screening partner), with the funding going to the location where the work will be carried out. Please note that all projects will need to develop not only a primary screening method but also a secondary screening method for hit validation.</li>

                        <ul>
                            <li>Based on NCE guidelines, teaching assistantship support cannot be counted as matching. Similarly, student and PDF fellowships from CIHR, NSERC or SSHRC cannot be counted as matching. Therefore, please do not include these as a partner contribution in your budget. Research fellowships provided by universities or non-federal agencies should be listed as matching and a supporting letter documenting support is needed.</li>
