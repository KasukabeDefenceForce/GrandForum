                <p>The Canadian Glycomics Network (GlycoNet) is a Network of Centres of Excellence that focuses on the role of glycans (carbohydrates) in health.  Areas of focus for GlycoNet are antimicrobials, chronic diseases (including diabetes & obesity), neurodegenerative diseases, and cancer.  Additional information about Network research can be found at <a href='http://www.glyconet.ca/' target='_blank'>www.glyconet.ca</a>.</p>
                
                <p>The Network is currently seeking Letters of Intent (LOI) for GlycoNet legacy projects. Legacy projects are multidisciplinary projects which can serve as a foundation for future large-scale funding applications post-NCE (e.g. NFRF, NSERC Alliance). Projects must highlight strengths of glycoscience both within the network and across Canada. The GlycoNet funding set aside for this competition is $400,000 over two years for two projects ($200,000/project).</p>
                
                <h2>Requirements</h2>
                Letters of Intent must:
                <ul>
                    <li>Have a project with a minimum of two independent laboratories with multidisciplinary expertise.</li>
                    <li>Primarily be targeted to the role/use of glycans in the treatment or prevention of infectious diseases, chronic diseases, neurodegenerative diseases, and/or cancer and/or lessening the economic burden of these diseases.</li>
                    <li>Lead to tangible deliverables by the end of the project that contribute to disease treatment or diagnosis.
                        <ul>
                            <li>Provide a vision as to how the deliverables align with a future funding mechanism.</li>
                            <li>Deliverables include intellectual property, processes, products, services, policies and/or clinical practice guidelines that can be developed with Partners and/or Stakeholders</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li>Demonstrate a 1:1 financial match with partner funding; at least 50% of the matching funds should be cash. Partner funding must be NCE eligible; in particular, other Canadian Federal funding (e.g., CIHR, NSERC, SSHRC, CFI) is ineligible for matching. Please contact <a href='mailto:info@glyconet.ca'>info@glyconet.ca</a> if you have specific questions about matching eligibility. The project budget must clearly show the co-contribution of partner funds in alignment with NCE and eligible project expenses.
                        <ul>
                            <li>Projects with a higher level of matching funds (e.g. 2:1 Partners:GlycoNet) will be viewed more favorably.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li>Indication that equity, diversity, and inclusion will be considered within the project team both at the Network Investigator and trainee level.</li>
                </ul>
                
                <h2>Eligibility</h2>
                <p>Based on NCE requirements, this opportunity is open only to individuals who are eligible to hold Tri-Council funds; CIHR, NSERC or SSHRC. Furthermore, GlycoNet requires that all investigators receiving Network funding must have other peer-reviewed support. Such support need not be from the Tri-Council. Questions about project suitability can be directed to the GlycoNet Administrative Office (<a href='mailto:info@glyconet.ca'>info@glyconet.ca</a>).</p>
                
                <h2>Registration and Letter of Intent</h2>
                <p>Registration must be done by emailing the project title, key words, a list of investigators and partners involved in the project, and an anticipated budget request to info@glyconet.ca by <b>June 25, 2021</b>. Upon registration, applicants will receive detailed instructions for completing the LOI in the GlycoNet Forum.</p>
                
                <p>The LOI will include the project title, a two-page project description, potential deliverables, a list of investigators and partners involved in the project, and an anticipated budget request (including matching funds). LOIs will be peer-reviewed by external reviewers and the RMC. The deadline for LOI submission is <b>July 15, 2021 (23:59 PST)</b>.</p>
                
                <p>GlycoNet Management will conduct a review of the LOI to ensure compliance with NCE evaluation criteria.  If an LOI is missing critical information, the applicants will be requested to provide the missing information within 48 hours, then re-submit through the GlycoNet Forum.  If an LOI is not updated as requested, it will be eliminated from the further review. Following LOI review, successful applicants will be invited to submit a full proposal.</p>
                
                <h2>Deadline</h2>
                <p>The LOI must be submitted through the GlycoNet Forum by <b>23:59 (PST) on July 15, 2021</b>.  LOIs received after this deadline will not be considered.</p>
                
                <h2>Full Application</h2>
                <p>We anticipate that full applications from those LOIs selected to move forward will be due October 29, 2021 with funding release in early 2022.</p>
                
                <h2>Additional Information</h2>
                <p>Questions about this opportunity can be sent to <a href='mailto:info@glyconet.ca'>info@glyconet.ca</a></p>

                <p>Letters from partners indicating the nature of their involvement in the project and their anticipated contribution (cash and/or in-kind) are recommended for the LOI, but not required.
