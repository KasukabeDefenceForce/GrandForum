Feature: Theme Leaders
    In order to see information about the projects that are in the themes that I lead
    As a Theme Leader
    I need to be able to see the full information about those projects as if I were a member

        Given I am logged in as "TL.User1" using password "TL.Pass1"

        Then I should see "Main"
        And I should see "Sub-Projects"
        And I should see "Dashboard"
        And I should see "Visualizations"
        And I should see "Wiki"
